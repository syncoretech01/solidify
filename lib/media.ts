 *
 * PHOTOS are the vetted masters in assets/media/ (see assets/media/CREDITS.txt
 * for provenance and the vetting record). Every photo was opened at full
 * resolution and examined through magnified crops for competitor livery, US
 * origin and identifiable people before it was admitted.
 *
 * LICENCE — Pexels / Unsplash licences and CC0: free for commercial use, no
 * model or property release. A person shown in any frame is a stock subject,
 * NOT a Solidify employee, operator or customer, and copy must never imply

 * A public slot must resolve to a vetted photograph — nothing reserved ever
 * ships. Each photograph carries at most two page:slot uses (QA-enforced).

 * The strongest frames sit where they are seen most. The frames that read as

 * grey transit shot - are used where the layout wants ground rather than
 * subject: dimmed rails, a backdrop behind a board, the loading beat of a
