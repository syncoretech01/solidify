/**
 * /become-a-driver — drivers who would run SOLIDIFY'S equipment.
 *
 * The page next door, /owner-operators, is for people who own their Truck /
 * Power Unit: they have an application to complete and, once approved,
 * onboarding paperwork to file. This page is the other audience entirely, and
 * it does NOT carry the external application portal.
 *
 * CONTENT RULE, and the reason this page reads the way it does: Solidify has
 * confirmed nothing about a company-driver programme — no pay basis, no
 * experience or endorsement minimums, no benefits, no hiring areas. None of
 * that is invented here. What the page states is the company (confirmed), the
 * work (a description of the trade, not a claim), and the federal rules that
 * bind every motor carrier (49 CFR 391, cited as regulation and never dressed
 * up as Solidify policy). Everything else is a conversation, so the page ends
 * in one instead of pretending to a job posting it cannot back.
 *
 * When the client supplies those facts, they belong in lib/site.ts and slot
 * into the ledger below without a layout change.
