/**
 * /terms — terms of use for THIS WEBSITE.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow, and section 03 says so on the page: these
 * terms govern using the site, not the carriage of a vehicle. The transport
 * itself is governed by whatever Solidify and the customer sign — a rate
 * confirmation, a transportation agreement, a bill of lading — and this page
 * must never be allowed to read as though it sets those terms.
 *
 * Nothing here invents a commercial position the client has not confirmed:
 * no cancellation fees, no claims window, no liability cap on cargo, no
 * delivery commitments, no dispute-resolution or arbitration clause. Where a
 * default was unavoidable it is a jurisdiction (California, where the company
 * is formed and based) and nothing more. This is a plain-language terms of
 * use written by an engineer, and it should be reviewed by the client's
 * attorney before it is relied on.
